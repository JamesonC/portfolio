The bigger the stylesheet the bigger the knot. My stylesheets were such a tangled mess that making a change to an existing class created an unintentional ripple effect throughout my sites. As a consequence, to make a predictable change I had to create a new, more specific class. Which meant a bigger stylesheet. Which resulted in a bigger knot."
