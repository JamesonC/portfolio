      "text": "Prior to learning about ClassPass I saw design and health as two separate, but indispensable parts of my life. Through working out and eating well I’ve been able to give my complete focus and energy to learning about design and development. I’ve been really interested in exercising and nutrition since I was a kid, as I played competitive soccer throughout my youth and through high school. In college I tore my ACL, but despite not being able to play soccer, I kept exercising by going to the gym and diving deeper into nutrition. For the past 4+ years I’ve been working out first thing in the morning and following a more rigorous diet. Exercising and proper nutrition gives me the energy, focus, and mood I need to thrive in my daily activities.  Exercising and proper nutrition are non-negotiable parts of my life and have played a crucial role in my growth as a designer and as a person."

My interest in leading a healthy life will help me better understand ClassPass member struggles because their struggles are also my struggles. I’m excited to learn about the product to make it easier for others to attend class and because I want to go to class as part of ClassPass. I want to live the ClassPass experience. I’m confident that my interest in leading a healthy life, my hunger to learn about design and development, and my current design/development skills will help me better appreciate the challenges and struggles ClassPass faces to successfully develop the right business solutions with the ClassPass team."
