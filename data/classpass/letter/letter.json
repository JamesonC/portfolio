After our chat over the holidays I've been learning more about the story of ClassPass and have fallen deeply in love with it's mission because one of the reasons I exercise daily and focus on proper nutrition is because of the positive impact it has on my other interests. The opportunity to join the ClassPass team is a unique opportunity where I'll be able to work on my two passions—design and health."

Throughout my childhood and through high school I played competitive soccer, where I learned about the importance of proper nutrition, consistency, and team work. During college I tore my ACL, which put my ability to play soccer on pause. During that time I got really into weight lifting and proper nutrition. I spent my college focusing on my classes and working on getting into the best shape possible. Since then I've been working out early in the morning during the week, which has helped me"

My interest in leading a healthy life will help me better understand ClassPass member struggles because their struggles are also my struggles. I’m excited to learn about the product to make it easier for others to attend class and because I want to go to class as part of ClassPass. I want to live the ClassPass experience. I’m confident that my interest in leading a healthy life, my hunger to learn about design and development, and my current design/development skills will help me better appreciate the challenges and struggles ClassPass faces to successfully develop the right business solutions with the ClassPass team."
