After our chat over the holidays I’ve been learning more about ClassPass and Payal’s story. Honestly, the more I learn about Payal’s vision for ClassPass the more I want to form a part of your team."

      "text": "Throughout my life I’ve played competitive sports, but not until I was in college did I learn about the benefits of consistent training and proper nutrition. Exercising and proper nutrition are a non-negotiable part of my life—not only because of the positive impact they have on other areas of my life, but also because I enjoy being fit, meeting new people, and reaching personal goals. I’m one of those guys that loves tracking things and measuring performance—I’ve measured body weight, tracked macronutrient intake, workout routines, and explored with innumerable weight lifting techniques and principles. I've made great friends at the gym and I've met all of my non-family clients while working out or through a gym connection. I’ve been working out first thing in the morning over the past 5 years and have seen the positive impact it’s had on my ability to learn and focus on what I care about the most. While in college exercising helped me focus in school and do my best in class. After I graduated I started getting my feet wet in design and as the years have gone by I’ve dedicated my energy and focus to learning about design and development. Exercise and proper nutrition will always play an important role in my life as they’ve not only helped me pursue my other passions with intensity, but they’ve also been a fun way of challenging myself to improve and grow as a person."

I’m confident that my hunger to learn and grow as a designer, my passion for exercising and staying fit, and my current design skills will help me better understand the challenges and obstacles ClassPass faces to build the right solutions with the ClassPass team. It'd be an honor to join Payal and the ClassPass team to create positive change in the world by helping people go to class and lead active, healthy lives as it's something I will always strive for."
