My father knew I was interested in learning more about web design and development and asked if I wanted to take care of the family business website. He offered full creative freedom and availability for business research and content details. At the time I had experience working with website builders and a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I accepted the offer and saw it as the perfect opportunity to learn more about the web while helping my family’s business in a small way."
