My father knew I was interested in learning more about design and development and asked me if I would like to design Materiales Valejo’s first website. He offered full creative freedom and availability for business research and content details. At the time I was working on a Squarespace website for a client and had basic knowledge of web-development. I immediately accepted the offer and saw it as the perfect opportunity to learn more about the web while helping my family’s business in a small way."
