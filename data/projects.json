Price negotiations are a very common part of the sales process. As a consequence, phone and in-person interactions are preferred over email and virtual forms of interaction because almost every sale goes through some form of negotiation. Clients engage with the business at least once a week to discuss product availability and pricing and to make new purchase orders."

For inventory management, the business does an in-person count every morning and adds the new data to an excel spreadsheet. To manage daily sales, the business manually goes through each receipt making sure the sales were made and the cash was received."

The secondary user profile was based on the profile of a potential secretary hire. Secretaries, unlike other job positions available in Materiales Vallejo, are familiar using a computer and own a personal email."
