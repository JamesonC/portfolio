To be honest, when I started the project I was solely focused on designing something to add to my portfolio. At the same time, I was so focused on what I wanted from the project that I forgot what the project was all about and who it was for. Fortunately, each new redesign was an opportunity to re-evaluate my intentions and as a consequence the project's objective. The hardest challenge I faced was not learning about JavaScript or progressive enhancement. The hardest challenge was becoming aware of my expectations to more accurately interpret business and user needs. Other challenges I faced included establishing an efficient process, communicating clearly with my client, setting clear project expectations, setting clear project deadlines, and learning about web development. One of the things I realized from this project is that doing things well takes more than three tries. There is no such thing as a perfect first try."
