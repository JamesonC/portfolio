The bigger the stylesheet the bigger the knot. My stylesheets were such a tangled mess that making a change to an existing class created an unintentional ripple effect throughout my sites. As a consequence, to make a predictable change I had to create a new, more specific class. Which meant a bigger stylesheet. Which resulted in a bigger knot."

I chatted with designer friends, inspected websites, read articles, and re-listened to several <a class=\"no-underline bb b--light-gray dark-gray dim\" href=\"https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details\" target=\"_blank\">Design Details</a> episodes. A friend of mine shared <a class=\"no-underline bb b--light-gray dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS and Scalability</a>, an article written by <a class=\"no-underline bb b--light-gray dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://mrmrs.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Morse</a> that talks about the benefits of function-based styling and his experience managing stylesheets. After reading more of Adam’s thoughts on CSS and learning about his active involvement with the development community, I found <a class=\"no-underline bb b--light-gray dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyons</a>, one of his side projects, and decided to give it a try on my next client project."

          "text": "At first, function-based styling felt wrong because it required an opposite approach to component-based styling. Instead of building UI components by adding a single, multi-property class I was building components by adding multiple, single-property classes. My component-based mindset refused to share a button’s padding with the site’s navigation menu and it hated cluttering my markup with so many classes. It wasn’t until I completed the first webpage that I became aware of the power of function-based styling. I realized my markup was readable, my classes reusable, and changes were predictable. What was once a bloated knot of overly specific classes became a collection of lean, globally reusable properties."

I quickly fell in love with the system mindset that is a result of prioritizing reusability. Instead of creating random, unrelated values for a component I started creating specific, scalable values for the entire website. Learning about function-based styling sparked an interest in learning more about design systems and their function in scaling digital products."
