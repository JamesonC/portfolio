They centered around paddings and borders and animations. My client's and I usually had differing ideas of what 'good design was'. As a consequence design critiques were only 'successful' when the client liked my designs. In retrospect, I was having a miserable time fighting for superficial, unintentional design whose sole purpose was to satisfy my own ideals. I was so stuck on the details that I forgot about the bigger picture."

I was emotionally attached to my work because of what I valued. I valued creating beautiful, magical, fairytale designs so much that I forgot about what or why I was designing in the first place. My obsession with 'good design' was so evident that it clouded my vision to focusing on solving the problem. I was so focused on the how that I forgot, time and time again, about the why or the who. The more expectations I had for the end (visual) result, the harder it was for me to focus on analyzing and solving business needs."

          "text": "I find it very challenging to enter a project with a blank slate and analyze things without any personal input or expectation of the end result. I don't know why I have this instinct to want to make things my own. It's ego, yes it is. But I believe the root of that ego is not evil or a result of being a bad designer. Its a result of valuing the wrong things. And I'm constantly working on redefining what I value to create useful, meaningful products for businesses."
