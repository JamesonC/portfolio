      "Hi there! I’m Claudio, a Mexican web designer / front-end developer freelancing from Monterrey, Mexico. At the moment I’m looking for a job opportunity in the United States as a Product Designer with a focus on design systems or business tools.",

      "I graduated from Baylor University with a BBA in Entrepreneurship on May 2014. I first learned about design my senior year of college as a part of the <a class=\"gray link\" href=\"http://www.baylor.edu/business/entrepreneurship/index.php?id=89585\" target=\"_blank\">Baylor Accelerated Ventures Program</a>. During my last semester I signed up for an introductory Media Design class and fell in love with design.",

      "After graduation I moved to Phoenix to help an old friend start a video production company. I lived in Phoenix for 9 months during which I learned about startups, business, video editing, animation, and worked for <a class=\"gray link\" href=\"http://brushfireinteractive.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brushfire Interactive</a> as a freelance Motion Designer.",

      "I moved to Monterrey, Mexico and worked for Parámetro Studio as a Junior Web Designer the fall of 2015. I left Parámetro and continued freelancing for Brushfire while working on web projects for local clients. During 2016 I learned about design process, front-end development and got a chance to be a part of Epicurrence in Moab, UT.",

      "My goals and aspirations are to become a US citizen, be a part of a team that works on a business product with global impact, stay healthy, and help new designers (like myself) learn about design and development."
