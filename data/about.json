      "Hi there! I’m Claudio, a Mexican web designer and front-end developer freelancing from Monterrey, Mexico. At the moment I’m looking for a job opportunity in the United States as a Product Designer working on design systems or business tools with global impact.",

      "I stumbled with design as a senior at Baylor University, where I designed my first logo as part of the <a class=\"no-underline bb--dotted dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://www.baylor.edu/business/entrepreneurship/index.php?id=89585\" target=\"_blank\">Baylor Accelerated Ventures Program</a>. During my last semester I took an intro to media design course where I worked on my first freelance project and found my first mentor. I decided to pursue a career as a graphic designer after graduating with a BBA in Entrepreneurship in May 2014.",

      "I moved to Phoenix, Arizona August 2014 with one of my best friends to start a video production company. I lived in Phoenix for 9 months during which I learned about business, graphic design, video editing, animation, and worked for <a class=\"no-underline bb--dotted dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://brushfireinteractive.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brushfire Interactive</a> as a freelance motion designer.",

      "My student Visa expired so I moved to Monterrey, Mexico where I worked for <a class=\"no-underline bb--dotted dark-gray dim\" href=\"http://parametrostudio.com/\" taget=\"_blank\">Parámetro Studio</a> as a junior web designer the fall of 2015. During 2016 I freelanced as a web designer/developer for local clients, continued working with Brushfire, and participated in several design events in the US.",

      "My goals for the near future are to join a design team in the US solving global business problems, be a part of and contribute to the design community, dive deeper into JavaScript web development, and become a US citizen."
