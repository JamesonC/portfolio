I had been following Dann for a couple of years and was a big fan of his vlogs, design work, and Epicurrence events. I knew the Epicsode was a unique opportunity to meet him and other designers from the Austin community."

I was considering not going, as I had to drive 5 hours from Mexico and obtain a border permit to maybe not make it. Is it worth it? Yeah it is. I got my permit and made the drive. Worst case scenario: I wait outside, say hi after the interview, and still call it a success."

I walked up an old, wooden staircase and entered a wide, spacious lobby covered in a blue-green carpet. And there, in front of me, was Dann wearing a white t-shirt, torn jeans, and Brazil flip flops and scratching his beard thinking deeply about the camera setup. I greeted him, semi-introduced myself (I mum-mumbled a bit), and asked if there was a chance of a spot opening up. He smiled and invited me to stay."

          "text": "The afternoon sped by and I got a chance to meet several Hispanic designers and a Baylor alumni. During the interview I learned about the Funsize approach to collaboration, team building, and agency management. The interview ended and I met Anthony and Edgar from Funsize. They heard I had driven from Mexico and were nice enough to offer a place to crash and a desk to work from the following day. I met a couple of other designers and then bumped into Dann again. We introduced again and he asked me about my work and what I did. He opened my Dribbble and looked up and asked me if I had heard of Epicurrence and if I had considered applying. Of course I have and I’ve actually already applied. Well, if you’re free in October, I’m inviting you to join us in Moab. He took out his phone and started scrolling through the invite list—it was full of designers I admired and followed on Twitter. He reached the bottom of the list and asked what my name was again. C-c-loud-ee-oo vah-yeh-hoe. Seriously? Am I dreaming?"

Dann joined the conversation and we continued chatting until the event ended at around 11PM. Before heading out Dann asked if I was interested in being a part of his Freelanced movie and exchanged contact details to possibly get together the following evening. Yup. I am dreaming."

          "text": "The following day I visited the Funsize offices and spent the afternoon with them. What I loved about meeting the Funsize team is that what Anthony and Natalie had talked about during the interview the day before was true—they were a group of talented designers who cared deeply about the people and creating a welcome, creative environment. They have an amazing office and it was pretty relaxing to work with them for a day. During my stay I got a chance to chat with Anthony about my journey as a designer on the Hustle Podcast. At around dinner time Dann and I met at the hotel he was staying at nearby and we chatter for about two hours. It was surreal getting a chance to share my experience freelancing with Dann and after the interview we walked Machado around the block as Dann shared his entire design journey with me. We said goodbye and I was excited to see him soon at Epicurrence in October."
