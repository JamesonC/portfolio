When @fat Tweeted about his experience applying for a job, I was pretty down for the following days. If @fat can't even interview, how in the world would I get a chance to interview for the companies I'd love to work for? A week passed and as I was browsing Twitter I stumbled with @dustin's Medium post. I was beyond excited for his initiative to connect young designers with leading experts through Out of Office Hours. Every time I refreshed the article new designers were added to the list. So I started scheduling 30 minute slots with designers I looked up to and by the end of the night my calendar was booked with 14 conversations for the holidays. I couldn't have asked for a better Christmas.

Over the past few weeks I've talked with 13 designers and each conversation has been invaluable. The interactions have ranged from interview-style chats to dynamic conversations. About 75% of the conversations were via video chat, and it was surreal to get 1-on-1 time with designers I look up to. I was quite scared for my first interview, but as I started going through the interviews I quickly realized the people I was engaging with were genuinely interested in helping out. Through these conversations I learned more about their stories, their journeys and their struggles. I learned about their process and approach to solving complex problems. I learned about their current focus and how they're preparing for future challenges. I got invaluable feedback on my portfolio, interview advice, application tips, and an opportunity for a potential job.

I've depended on videos, articles, and podcasts to learn about design and development since I started designing a couple of years ago. I've learned most of what I currently know online and owe everything to social media platforms, designers, and companies that have opened up and shared their experiences and thoughts about design. While these resources are invaluable and form a big part of what I know about design and development, I wouldn't have learned as fast as I did without a mentor. I've been lucky that one of my best friends has been my mentor even before I started designing. My friend has shared his knowledge about which tools to use to build projects and how to approach design (and personal) challenges. My friend's mentorship (or friendship) has been the most valuable resource I have...
